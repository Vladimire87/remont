# Scripts

Run these helpers from the repository root:

- `./scripts/setup.sh` — installs npm dependencies.
- `./scripts/dev.sh` — starts the Vite dev server (`npm run dev -- --host`).
- `./scripts/test.sh` — executes the Vitest suite.

Scripts are POSIX compliant and expected to work on macOS and Linux shells.
